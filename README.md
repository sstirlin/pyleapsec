This is a simple Python 2.7 library (meant to be copy/pasted) that allows you to convert between
various date/time conventions, namely

- UTC
- Unix timestamp
- TAI
- GPS

This library tracks leap seconds (note:  the standard Python modules do NOT).  For a good
discussion of the issues (and why Unix timestamps suck), read this:
